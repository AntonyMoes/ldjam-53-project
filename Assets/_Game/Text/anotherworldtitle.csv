The Returning,The Reincarnation,The Work,The Call,The Life and suffering,The weekend goes wrong and instead goddess decides to start journey,,,
of a demon,of a fisherman,of an office worker,of an engineer,of a student,of a hunter,of a banker,of a butcher,of a robber
in another world,into the world of sword and magic,into the world of fairies,in the world of wild animals,into a post-apocalyptic future,into an alternate reality,in the Middle Ages but the goddess was against,in the wild west,
